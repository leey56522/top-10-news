This is a simple web app that displays 10 top current news's title, image and summary.
The data is obtained through NewsX API.

## Things I learned
1. Make use of an API from rapidAPI.com 
2. Reinforce the concept of map function in JavaScript to render texts and images
3. Reinforce the concept of string manipulation by shortening the summary to 15 words. The rest will be represented by '...'

## Challenge encountered
1. Figuring out ways to use rapidAPI.com 

## Upcoming changes
1. Create a reload button for users to get more news
2. Create a drop down of full summary when user clicks each news
